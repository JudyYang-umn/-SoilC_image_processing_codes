The codes were used in the paper "4D imaging reveals mechanisms of clay-carbon protection and release"

The code in the file “Scan3D_findmax_Oct20.m” was used to find the maximum fluorescence intensity in the vertical scans, the maximum fluorescence intensity in the vertical direction was assumed to correspond to the center/mid depth of the chamber. 

The code in the file “Clay_3Dimages_June_2020” was used to find the outer surface of the clay aggregates based on the contrast of the fluorescence intensity in clay aggregates and in the background. Then the code calculates the average fluorescence intensity in clay. 

The codes “Profile_Top_exoenzyme_experiment.m” and “Diffusivity_greenred.m” were used to plot the fluorescence intensity along a transect “line” and calculate the diffusivity.
